  - question: What is class imbalance in the context of Parasol insurance claims datasets?
    answer: |
      Class imbalance refers to the situation where the number of non-claims instances far exceeds
      that of actual claims, posing challenges for predictive modeling.

  - question: What types of information are included in the Policyholder Information feature?
    answer: |
      The Policyholder Information feature includes demographic details such as age, gender, occupation,
      marital status, and geographical location.

  - question: What kind of data is contained in the Claim History feature?
    answer: |
      The Claim History feature contains information regarding past insurance claims, including claim amounts,
      types of claims, frequency of claims, and claim durations.

  - question: What details are provided under the Policy Details feature?
    answer: |
      The Policy Details feature includes details about the insurance policies held by policyholders,
      such as coverage type, policy duration, premium amount, and deductibles.

  - question: What are Risk Factors in the context of Parasol Insurance Claims data?
    answer: |
      Risk Factors are variables indicating potential risks associated with policyholders, such as credit score,
      driving record, health status, and property characteristics.

  - question: What kind of information is included in the External Factors feature?
    answer: |
      The External Factors feature includes factors external to the policyholders that may influence claim likelihood,
      such as economic indicators, weather conditions, and regulatory changes.

  - question: How can the Parasol Insurance Claims data be used for Risk Assessment?
    answer: |
      The data can be used to assess the risk associated with insuring a particular policyholder based
      on their characteristics and historical claim behavior.

  - question: What is the purpose of using Parasol Insurance Claims data for Policy Pricing?
    answer: |
      The data helps in determining appropriate premium amounts for insurance policies by estimating the
      expected claim frequency and severity.

  - question: How can the data be used for Fraud Detection?
    answer: |
      The data can be used to identify fraudulent insurance claims by detecting anomalous patterns in claim submissions
      and policyholder behavior.

  - question: What is Customer Segmentation in the context of Parasol Insurance Claims data?
    answer: |
      Customer Segmentation involves segmenting policyholders into distinct groups based on their risk profiles
      and insurance needs to tailor marketing strategies and policy offerings.

  - question: What does the term 'policy id' refer to in the dataset?
    answer: |
      'Policy id' is a unique identifier for the insurance policy.

  - question: How does the 'customer age' feature influence insurance claims?
    answer: |
      'Customer age' refers to the age of the policyholder, which can influence the likelihood of claims.

  - question: What impact does 'vehicle age' have on claim probability?
    answer: |
      'Vehicle age' affects the probability of claims due to factors like wear and tear.

  - question: Why is the 'model' of the vehicle included in the dataset?
    answer: |
      The 'model' of the vehicle could impact the claim frequency due to model-specific characteristics.

  - question: How does the 'fuel type' of a vehicle influence the risk profile?
    answer: |
      'Fuel type' (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG) might influence the risk profile and claim likelihood of the vehicle.

  - question: What do 'max torque' and 'max power' describe in the dataset?
    answer: |
      'Max torque' and 'max power' describe the engine performance characteristics, which could relate
      to the vehicle’s mechanical condition and claim risks.

  - question: What does the 'engine type' feature indicate?
    answer: |
      'Engine type' indicates the type of engine, which might have implications for maintenance and claim rates.

  - question: Why is 'region code' important in the insurance claims data?
    answer: |
      'Region code' represents the geographical region of the policyholder, as claim patterns can vary regionally.

  - question: What does 'region density' show, and why is it relevant?
    answer: |
      'Region density' shows the population density of the policyholder’s region, which could correlate with
      accident and claim frequencies.

  - question: How does the number of 'airbags' in a vehicle influence claim probability?
    answer: |
      The number of 'airbags' in a vehicle indicates its safety level, which can influence the probability of claims.

  - question: What does the 'claim status' feature indicate in the dataset?
    answer: |
      'Claim status' indicates whether a claim was made (1) or not (0), and is the dependent variable the model
      aims to predict.
